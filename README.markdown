# dora_explorer

A couple of programs for dealing with Dora's data. This is written in rust and requires a few external libraries. This project creates two programs. One lets us view a directory of 16bit tiff images with some augmentation. The other processes each stack to produce the data we need.

## Requirements


## Building

If you have rust installed, enter the swiss_parse directory and type

    cargo build

I think it's a good idea to make sure your rust compilier is up-to-date. I've fallen afoul of this a few times

    rustup upgrade
